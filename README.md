# LCA-Java
3rd Year Software Engineering Assignment
Initially both Java and Pyhton implementations of the LCA Assignment were placed in one repository.
However, the Python implementation has since been moved to a seperate repository at "https://github.com/Kishore11N/LCA-Python".
Both implementations were placed in the first repository that has since been renamed to "LCA-Java" before the deadline.
