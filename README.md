# LCA-Java
Initially both Java and Python implementations of the LCA Assignment were placed in one repository.
However, the Python implementation has since been moved to a seperate repository at "https://github.com/Kishore11N/LCA-Python".
Both implementations were placed in the first repository that has since been renamed to "LCA-Java" before the deadline.

The Directed Acyclic Graph has been implemented in the lowestCommonAncestor file and its tests are in the lowestCommonAncestorTest file within this repository.

Metrics Report was already submitted to BlackBoard before deadline.
