Biography and Metrics Report within this repositiory.  
Metrics report was submitted to BlackBoard before deadline, and was added to the repository at a later stage.



GitHub Access - Git Access Folder  
My Git Access code interrogates the API to collect information from a user's repository to find : 
 - The name of each contributor
 - The number of commits/contributions each contributor made
 - The number of repositories each of the contributors worked on  
 The output of my code is a csv file, that can then be used as an input in the D3.js visualisation.
 


D3.js Visualisation    

For my visual, I have decided to analyse the relationship between the no. of contributions made to a repository,  
and the number of repositories previously worked on by a user to see if the experience of a user affected their 
contribution amount in a given repository. 


1. In order to run the visual, you must have Python3 installed.  
2. Open the terminal and switch to the directory of the folder.  
3. Then type the following command : python -m http.server  
4. Then in your web browser, you should type the localhost provided. (E.g. localhost:8000)    

I have provided two csv files within the folder that you can test using the html file.  
If you go to line 28 of the html file and change the name from "data1.csv" to "data2.csv" you can test the two files.
